Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With small number of simulations, sometimes Belgium have 0% chance of winning

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

100000 is good enough. Because list and sort of teams have a chance of winning wont change when we increase the number
